# AirFlowDetector_Arduino

The objective of this project is to implement the Air Flow Sensor using filament of a bulb.
The light bulb filament has a negative temperature coefficient and because of that its filament resistance change inversely to the temperature.The filament of an incandescent bulb is the sensing part of the circuit. The filament can be made by removing the glass of a 40W incandescent bulb. This circuit gives a visual indication of the rate of airflow and the brightness of the LED at its output will be varied proportionally to the airflow.
